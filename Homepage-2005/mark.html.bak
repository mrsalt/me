<p><font size="+1" face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica">This last year in college I really 
  enjoyed working with other students in the CS department in a new chapter of 
  the ACM.&nbsp; We held numerous club workshops on topics of interest to 
  club members throughout the semester. In addition we had social activities 
  and joined with the ACM-W (Women's) chapter for events. Interestingly enough I met Kimberly (my wife) trhough 
  this as she was president of ACM-W.  In November we organized 
  programming teams and competed at the ACM Rocky Mountain Regional Programming 
  Competition. We held an AI game programming contest with <a href="http://otherland.cs.usu.edu/~acm/riskcentral.html">RISK</a> (the 
  board game). In my spare time fall semester I programmed the game and provided 
  an interface for club members to program their own AI for the game. I was very 
  enthusiastic about this game and the club contest. I appreciate the support and interest that other students showed toward this organization; it was a lot of fun.&nbsp;
