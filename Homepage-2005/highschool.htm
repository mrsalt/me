  School Projects </font></h1>
<p>My real interest in programming started back in 8th grade. I had QuickBasic 
  4.5 installed on our family's computer and with the help of a few books I checked 
  out from the library I started teaching myself how to program. I think I enjoy 
  programming so much (and software development in general) because I have always 
  enjoyed building things -- mechanical things, models, experiments, whatever. 
  I also enjoyed art classes and other forms of self-expression. Math and Science 
  have also been favorite subjects. Programming has always been a way for me to 
  combine all the things I like into one. </p>

  Massacre (Spring 1994)</font></font></font></b></font></p>
<p>Medieval Massacre is a multiplayer (one computer) graphical game written in 
  QuickBasic. It was the first large project I ever completed. It showed a map 
  of a kingdom and the goal was to conquer other player's castles. As soon as 
  their last castle was destroyed they were eliminated from the game. It was an 
  excellent experience. It really got me excited about programming. The difficulty 
  in maintaining the code and the style I used in writing the game have convinced 
  me of the benefits of object oriented programming. The project became huge - 
  it exceeded 5,000 lines of code. Because of its size and the way it was written 
  it would be a nightmare to try and go back and understand it all now.</p>

  Editor (Summer 1995)</font></font></font></b></font></p>
<p>My best friend and I had decided to create a role playing game. He worked on 
  the story and helped a little bit with programming, while I figured out how 
  to do the programming part. The game would use tiled images as the basis for 
  the graphics. To help with the creation of these tiles I created an editor (which 
  used the mouse and wasn't too common for QuickBasic programs) which could work 
  with a set of tiles. These sets of tiles could also be associated with multiple 
  palettes. I created commands which you could click on to perform various functions 
  - including merging images and shifting the palettes. There were also nice features 
  to edit the palettes and customize the colors, as well as blend palette colors 
  together over a range of colors. The real beauty that I saw was the ability 
  to create one tile and then with a careful selection of colors shift the palettes 
  to make it appear that the seasons were changing. I added the ability to animate 
  different tiled images also. </p>

  Builder (Summer 1995)</font></font></font></b></font></p>
<p>The world builder was an editor which helped to create the world for the game. 
  The game world was huge so a nice world buider was necessary. The world builder 
  drew the screen in memory from the tiles and then allowed you to scroll around 
  the world, refershing tiles when necessary. Some of the nice features were the 
  ability to smooth mountains together and drag and draw roads and shorelines. 
  There were also features to zoom out to different levels and then zoom-in at 
  different locations. </p>

  Builder (Summer 1996)</font></font></font></b></font></p>
<p>My best friend and I were excited about the bridge building contest at Utah 
  State University but we ran into some difficulties in designing our bridges. 
  We had some basic design rules in mind, but we weren't sure how to optimize 
  our design. I wrote a program which would show relative beam strengths pased 
  upon the parameters which were input, and then it was simply a matter of re-arranging 
  the input (and the structural design) to maximize the strength of the weakest 
  beam and try to make it so all beams had equal strength. We were happy to build 
  some bridges as high school students which surpassed in strength the bridges 
  built by the engineering students on campus. My friend won the contest the next 
  spring with a bridge holding 2500 lbs, the next closest bridge holding somewhere 
  around 1800-1900 lbs.</p>

  Photo Accounting Software (Summer 1997)</font></b></p>
<p>My father runs his own Photography business and to make his life simpler he 
  wanted me to write a program for him to record his account information. He wanted 
  the ability to group income and expense items into hierarchies and then generate 
  reports that he could use for his own interest and for tax purposes. I was quite 
  happy with the program because of the speed in which I developed it and the 
  use my father got out of the program. Later on I discovered that Quicken had 
  much the same functionality as the program I had written. I also discovered 
  once I was in college that it would have been much easier to create windowed 
  applications with better development tools than the ones I had used (like Visual 
  C++ or Visual Basic). </p>
