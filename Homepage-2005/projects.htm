<h4 style="margin-left: 0" align="left">Ever since I have learned how to program 
  I have always been working on some kind of project. I like to dream big. The 
  tendency I have to work hard and enjoy it have been the fuel to carry out the 
  projects I have worked on. Sometimes I have been paid to work on these projects 
  - other times it has been purely for fun / sense of accomplishment. The best 
  scenario is when I have been able to combine the two motives. I have a great 
  deal of pride in the work I do and enjoy the work that I put into them.</h4>
