  Description:</h2>
<p>LADA is the name for a joint venture between the Space Dynamics Laboratory 
  (SDL) and the Institute of Biological Medical Studies (IBMP) in Moscow, Russia. 
  The purpose of LADA is to further study the effects of microgravity on plant 
  growth and the effectiveness of a controlled environment life support system 
  in space. Gail Bingham, the senior scientist in charge of LADA, was recently 
  awarded the governor's medallion by governor Leavitt for his contributions to 
  science in Utah. </p>
<p>My role was to create the software which would be used to collect the data 
  for the experiment and serve as a control interface for the Russian cosmonauts 
  who would be controlling the experiment. I really enjoyed this project because 
  of the challenging nature and because of the opportunities I had to learn from 
  the project. The project was challenging because I was inexperienced and the 
  task wasn't simple. I was to build a system which would communicate with existing 
  hardware in C++ (which was new to me) with MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes), 
  which no one on the job had any clue about.</p>

<h2>What I did:</h2>
<p>After researching serial communications and figuring out how terminal emulators 
  worked, I created a base communication class and then a derived class which 
  encapsulated the communication operations which would be needed to communicate 
  with the data collection / controlling hardware. After these base communication 
  classes had been created I began designing an interface and scoping out the 
  requirements for the software. In addition to taking numerical data the software 
  also used TWAIN to grab images from digital cameras and store those pictures. 
  The software changes between English and Russian by pressing the F2 key. I enjoyed 
  learning MFC to create a GUI for the system. </p>
<p>Later on two more individuals were hired to help in different aspects with 
  the work I was doing. This changed the role that I had from that of a sole developer 
  to more of a software development leader. One individual was hired to help specifically 
  with the software and another was hired to help with translation and project 
  documentation. Although the nature of the experiment sounds simple enough, the 
  number of things LADA needed to be able to automate and the degre to which things 
  needed to be changeable made the project quite extensive.</p>

  work I did for SDL was truly rewarding and I hope that the experiment will be 
  a huge success. Last year I travelled to Moscow twice as a result of my involvement 
  with the project. </p>
