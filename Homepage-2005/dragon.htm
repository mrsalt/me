  the left is an image created by the 3D graphics rendering program I made while 
  taking CS 5400 (Graphics) last year. The graphics rendering program was built 
  form the ground up. The image is constructed from a large array of polygons 
  which are projected into space relative to the viewpoint, mapped onto a two 
  dimensional plane, sorted by distance, and then drawn from farthest to closest 
  with the shade of the color of the polygon determined by the dot product of 
  the light source and the normal vector of each polygon. </p>

<p>3D graphics is one of my major interests. I would love to do something at some 
  point in the future involving 3D graphics. I have enjoyed thinking about and 
  researching different algorithms and tecniques that can or could be used to 
  create 3D graphics.</p>
