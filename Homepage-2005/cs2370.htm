  List Support Software</font></h1>
<p>Mailing List Support Software was a project for CS 2370 (Software Engineering). 
  Our class divided into six teams with five or six individuals on each team. 
  The responsibility of each team was to design and build a software product following 
  the software engineering principles which we were taught in class. A regional 
  business contacted our class about developing a customized application to help 
  create and maintain a database of customers and contacts in order to accomplish 
  their goal of becoming a clearinghouse for mailing lists. This business hoped 
  to reduce the amount of junk mail sent to people and improve their current response 
  rate by matching the needs of contacts with businesses.</p>
<p>As a team we met twice a week to discuss the project, make assignments to group 
  members and review previous assignments. The work was broken into multiple phases. 
  This project was beneficial not so much because of the actual product that was 
  developed but because of the principles that we learned - especially team dynamics. 
  We helped each other to learn the principles we were taught in class. The group 
  chose me to be the team leader. I enjoyed that and also found it a bit frustrating 
  when I could tell some members were working harder at the project than others. 
  A very large focus in the class was learning how to express design ideas with 
  UML diagrams. I think UML is a great tool for capturing ideas while developing 
  or planning software. </p>
