  Description:</h2>
<p>Over the summer I decided that it would be a lot of fun to get a computer science 
  club going this year. I felt that I had been fortunate to have some unique opportunities 
  to learn some neat stuff through my employmers and through projects on my own. 
  I also thought that there was plenty I could learn from other students in the 
  CS program also. I had an idea for a club contest that people could enjoy and 
  learn a lot from - RISK. The idea was to make it easy to create a .DLL to handle 
  the AI logic of a computer oponent, let club members create their own computer 
  AIs and at the end have a competition where every computer AI got to play against 
  every other over and over again. One teacher, Linda DuHadway, assigned her students 
  to work on part of the program for one of their programming assignments as they 
  were studying graph theory and applications at the time.</p>

<h2>What I did:</h2>
<p>I started work on RISK in August and basically finished in October. I estimate 
  I spent about 80 hours working on the program and rules and everything for the 
  contest. At the start of the semester I publicized the orgnization of ACM for 
  individuals interested in Computer Science. I got some other individuals who 
  were willing to support join in the leadership and we asked for input from people 
  about what they would be interested in learning more about during the semester. 
  I put together a web page to help collect this information. As people registered 
  for ACM they were also asked to rate their interest in a variety of topics. 
  As it turns out people were very interested in learning some of the things that 
  it took to develop RISK. (DLLs, MFC, Graphics, ...). We have held workshops 
  about these topics and others throughout this past semester. More information 
  about the club and the contest is available at the <a href="http://www.cs.usu.edu/%7Eacm">ACM 
  website</a>.</p>

<p>I decided to work on the most difficult part of the game first. I felt that 
  this would be creating the board interface. I created the board as an ActiveX 
  control first in Visual Basic and then when I had trouble getting the graphics 
  to work right I made the same control in MFC. There really wasn't too much coding 
  to it - just a few tricks I had to work out. Next I created a C++ DLL which 
  would serve as the manager for the other DLLs and an interface for the user 
  interface portion of the game. The user interface portion I wrote with Visual 
  Basic. The manager DLL loads the player DLLs and gives those DLLs access to 
  information about the state of the game (who owns what countries and how many 
  armies they have on those countries, what countries are connected to what other 
  countries, etc.). The manager DLL loads each players DLL separately and checks 
  to make sure that they have exported the functions required by the game. </p>
