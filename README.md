This repository contains information about me.  I'm an experienced firmware/software developer presently looking for a job.

You can find my resume [here](resume-full.md).  There's a shorter version [here](resume-short.md).

You can find my LinkedIn profile [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-salisbury-44044b1/).

<h2>Why post my resume on GitHub?</h2>

As I was updating my resume in Microsoft Word, I had an uneasy feeling as I realized I'm using a process unfriendly for version control.  Besides, while I can use Microsoft Word OK, it has these odd editing quirks that can drive a person a little crazy.

Plus, putting my resume in GitHub allows me to publish it to the world.  Which is good.  It also allows you to see my changes and mistakes along the way (unless I overwrite master with a force push...).  That's OK.
