## Experience

### Aug. 2002 – Present, *Firmware Engineer*,	**HP Inc., Boise ID**

#### Localization (C++, Python), Nov 2018 - Present
* Recognized that HPs different printer business units have flaws in the localization process and firmware implementation of localization.
* Led out on the design of a new process and firmware implementation, eliminating missing translations.
* These changes will result in greater accuracy and lower cost.

#### [HP Accessibility Assistant](https://www.google.com/search?q=hp+accessibility+assistant) (C++, JavaScript), Jul 2017 - Aug 2018
* Contributor to the design and implementation of the HP Accessibility Assistant, a device and set of firmware features that make HP devices more accessible to users with disabilities (see [508 Refresh](https://www.google.com/search?q=508+refresh)).
* Though I contributed to this effort in several areas, my main deliverable was the design and implementation of a screen reader built into the UI.
* Project was done by a team of hardware engineers and 3 software engineers – our efforts enabled HP to win hundreds of millions of dollars of contracts.

#### SysTrace WebViewer (HTML5, JavaScript), May 2014 - Present
* Developed HTML5 application to view and analyze low-level logs from HP printers; viewer shows visually how CPUs are allocating clock cycles between different tasks.  It shows key events that are occurring on the device.
* It has been instrumental in solving various performance and other defects; it’s been used by HP engineers around the globe.

#### [Omni (Web-Based Enterprise Printer/Copier) User Interface](https://www.google.com/search?q=hp+futuresmart+4+control+panel) (C++, JavaScript, CSS), Jan 2013 - Present
* Helped develop modern web-based UI for HP Printer/Copiers.  User interface has been praised by customers for responsiveness and ease of use.
* Solved many technical problems – memory leaks, server driven eventing for REST based data models, key based navigation, etc.
* Made our unit test suite run FAST.  We developed a qunit based test suite.  I parallelized it to run on 8 (or more) CPU cores at a time.
* Every code integration tests our UI unit test suite of 8,000+ JavaScript driven unit tests – both behavior and screen capture based.  Test suite completes in about 3 minutes.

#### [WebKit](http://www.webkit.org) Browser (C++ / C,  HTML 5, JavaScript, ARM, MIPS & x86), Jul 2009 - Present
* Lead engineer in HP on WebKit.  WebKit powers web browsers, including Safari and Chrome*.  WebKit has 3+ million lines of code.
* Kept WebKit up to date, adding new capabilities to our browser (like remote debugger) and created Windows CE browser platform for next generation UI.  This UI powers all HP Enterprise copiers and printers today.
* Solved challenging performance problems in our display driver more than doubling the frames per second (huge improvement in UI responsiveness).
* Solved complex problems, including issues with CPU architecture, compiler bugs, browser performance issues, and native to .NET (COM interop) ref counting / memory management and threading problems.
* Set up continuous integration process and created test framework, including an original scripting language to enable browser testing.

#### OXPd SDKs (.NET / C#, Java, ASP.NET), Aug 2008 - Jul 2009
* Worked with senior architect responsible for OXPd 1.6 architecture to move project from prototype to production; developed initial SDK, including demo application, continuous integration process, and initial tests.

#### Jedi Extensibility SDKs (.NET / C#), Aug 2008 - Jul 2009
* Designed and implemented UI related 3rd party SDKs in firmware (Menus, Internal Pages, Help, Localization).
* Recognized (and convinced others of) supportability problems with original Menus SDK design; designed and implemented simpler solution.

#### DoD CAC (US Government Smart Card Authentication (C++/C)
* Led development work for Common Access Card (CAC) authentication and e-mail signing solution for OZ based MFP products, moving HP ahead of competitors for US Department of Defense sales.
* Integrated/ported OpenSSL and Heimdahl open source libraries.
* Created smart alloc tool, used initially for OpenSSL and Heimdahl but later used for many other libraries to help identify memory leaks by assigning unique identifiers for memory allocations without changing source code.

#### MFP Current Product Engineering Team (C++, PHP, SQL, Java)
* Delivered crucial new functionality and defects fixes to meet customer needs, often helping to make additional sales (sometimes valued in the millions of dollars).  Often worked on complex issues (like memory corruption, memory leaks, duration test issues) or parts of the system our team was not experienced with.
* **MIMS (Mark’s Information Management System)**: Developed website / database for team, which managed many aspects of our software development lifecycle:
  * Team members felt that system helped dramatically with productivity.

### Aug 2013 – Oct 2014, *Software Engineer*,	**[dzinesteps.com](http://www.dzinesteps.com)** (JavaScript, MySQL)
* Designed and implemented website to help homeowners and designers visualize changes to their existing home or new home.
* Learned how to use WebGL, an API for 3D rendering in web browsers.
* Authored performant imaging algorithms in JavaScript.

### May 2001 – Oct 2001, *Software Engineer*,	**INL, Idaho Falls UT** (VB6, C++)
* Responsible for design and implementation of RISK Monitor, a system to support operators and managers in mission critical systems.  First implementation of RISK Monitor was for the St. Petersburg nuclear power plant, other potential implementations included International Space Station.
* Exceeded management’s expectations with RISK Monitor project in quality and speed of delivery of product.  Led team of interns in carrying out the design and implementation of RISK Monitor.

### Sep 2000 – Dec 2001, *Tutor*,	**Computer Science Department, Utah State University, Logan, UT** (C++/Java)
* Helped 10-20 students a week learn to solve computer science problems.  “In the tutor room, Mark has been one of our most popular tutors.  He is friendly and students feel immediately comfortable coming to him for help.”  Vicki Allan, Associate Professor USU.

### Dec 1999 – Sep 2001, *Undergraduate Research Assistant*,	**Space Dynamic Laboratory, Logan, UT** (C++/MFC)
* Lead programmer on team of (student) engineers developing software and hardware for experiment LADA, which flew aboard the International Space Station from 2002-2006.
* I was responsible for the software, which helped the astronaut set up the experiment, collected data as the experiment ran, and graphed probe data as it was collected.
* Software used serial interface to communicate with data logger, USB interface to communicate with webcam.  Project was MFC based.

## Personal Projects

### Jan 2011 - 2013, "Medieval Settlers"	*Android App* (Java, Eclipse)
* Implemented game engine, AI, and user interface, based on Settlers of Catan board game.
* Created graphics and incorporated artwork.
* Created AI test program, which has played millions of games (in a reproducible fashion) and helped me find bugs in my AI.
* I intend for app to be free, with paid expansions.  Never published, wasn't fully polished and didn't want potential legal fights.

### Nov 2007 - Apr 2008, "Travian Database"	*Online Game Tool* (PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, Google Maps)
*	Created website, based on Google Maps API, to help visualize changes in MMORPG Travian.  Alliance of players used website to coordinate game playing.  Working on this added a whole new dimension to the game.

* Created website (together with a co-worker) to help leaders and boys track progress in scouting.
* Created scripts to import merit badge and rank advancement data to keep site up to date as BSA changes requirements.
* Made site open to other troops.

### Aug 2001 - Feb 2002, "RISK"	*Windows Game* (VB6, C++, ActiveX)
* Created game as an opportunity to get other students excited about learning new technologies and as a way to compete against each other.
* Competition was a key event for ACM chapter at USU that year.
* Main game UI control was created using C++ / ActiveX, while core game interface was written in VB 6.
* AI .dlls could be loaded dynamically as long as they were programmed using the SDK I published.

## Education
